User can create a listing with the item description (and images), a starting price, and a minimum price for an instant buy if desired. Also specify the timeframe of the listing, with a minimum of a day.


When someone bids on the auction item, make sure that the bid is greater than the starting price, more broadly the current price. Update the listing accordingly.


If the bid reaches the instant buy price, complete the transaction and remove the listing.


Once the countdown timer is over, complete the transaction with the highest bid. If no bids were placed, remove the listing from the market.
