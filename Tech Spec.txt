User can create a listing with the item description (and images), a starting price, and a minimum price for an instant buy if desired. Also specify the timeframe of the listing, with a minimum of a day.


When someone bids on the auction item, make sure that the bid is greater than the starting price, more broadly the current price. Update the listing accordingly.


If the bid reaches the instant buy price, complete the transaction and remove the listing.


Once the countdown timer is over, complete the transaction with the highest bid. If no bids were placed, remove the listing from the market.


For buyers, provide the ability to auto bid. After setting a maximum price that they are willing to pay, as well as an increase in price over the current maximum bid (that is not their own), any bid that exceeds the buyer's bid will be matched. However, as this takes away some of the profitability of the site (through ads for example), it might be smart to add a fee for using this service.
